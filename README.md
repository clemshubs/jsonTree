# jsonTree

First stone of a command-line conditionnal scheduler of operations.
This parses a json and print a tree in ASCII in the standard output with a part of (what I think is to be) functionnal programming.
I would like the structure of the conditionnal tree to be configurable, but, hey, it is a first version.

The code may hurt some feelings, please be gentle, I start coding in Go.

Cheers,
CHA
